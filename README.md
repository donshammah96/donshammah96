-# 👋 Hey there, I'm Don Shammah!

## About Me
- 🎂 28 years old, but I still get ID’d—must be the coding glow-up!
- 💻 Started my coding journey a year ago, and let’s just say, I’ve been hitting the books harder than my Apex Legends rank.
- 🎓 Graduated from **CS50x**, **CS50p**, and almost leveled up to complete **CS50AI**.
- 🚀 Dreaming of becoming a **Kernel Engineer** and **Backend Developer**—because why settle for just one thing when you can have both?

## A Little More About Me
- ⚽ Soccer lover—whether it's kicking a ball or screaming at the screen, I’m there.
- 🎶 Music is my jam. Seriously, my playlist is more diverse than my skill set.
- 💼 Used to trade stocks—now I trade sleep for more coding.
- 🎓 Major in Economics and Finance, but I’ve decided that **Computer Science** is my true calling. Sorry, Wall Street.
- 🎮 When I'm not coding, you’ll find me on the battlefield of Apex Legends, where I’m slightly better at dodging bullets than debugging code.

## Why I’m Here
- 🤝 Looking to connect with fellow novice devs, seasoned pros, and anyone who’s down to share the struggle and the victories.
- 🧠 The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don’t know—basically, I’m getting smarter by feeling dumber!

## Let’s Connect
- **Apex Legends** squad up? Sure, just don’t expect me to carry.
- Got tips on kernel engineering or backend dev? Send them my way! Or we can just chat about how painful it is to debug C code.

💬 **Fun fact**: I write code like I play soccer—lots of running around, occasional brilliance, and plenty of trips to Stack Overflow.
